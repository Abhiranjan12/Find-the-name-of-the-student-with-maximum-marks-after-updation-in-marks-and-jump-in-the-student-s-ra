'''Your task is to find the name of the student with maximum marks after updation in marks and the jump in the student’s rank i.e., previous rank – current rank. 
You are given three lists` names, mark`s and update`s where: 
    • Names contain the names of students.
    • Marks contain the marks of the same students.
    • Updates contains the integers by which the marks of these students are to be updated.
(Number of levels a student is ranking up or down must be displayed) '''
